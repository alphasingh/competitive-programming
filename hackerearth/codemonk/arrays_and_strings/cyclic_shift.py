EXPLANATION:
For the 1st test case, the value of B is (11010).
After performing 4 cyclic shifts the value represented by array A
becomes equal to B for the first time.
After performing additional 5 cyclic shifts the value represented by array A
becomes B for the second time. Hence, the answer is
4 + 5 = 9

For the 2nd test case, the value of B is (101010).
After performing 1 cyclic shifts the value represented by array A
becomes equal to B for the first time.
After performing additional 2 cyclic shifts the value represented by array A
becomes B for the second time. Hence, the answer is
1 + 2 = 3
